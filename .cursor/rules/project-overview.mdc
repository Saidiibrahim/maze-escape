# Project Overview

This project is a first-person shooter (FPS) game built with Three.js, set in a randomly generated maze.

-   **HTML Entry Point:** The main HTML structure, styles for UI elements (start screen, score, health bar, crosshair, minimap container), audio elements, and the import map for Three.js modules are defined in [index.html](mdc:index.html).
-   **Game Logic:** All core game logic resides in [main.js](mdc:main.js). This includes scene setup (lighting, floor, skybox), random maze generation, loading the GLTF gun model, player controls (PointerLockControls), movement physics, shooting mechanics (bullets, collisions), target and enemy spawning/behavior, health system, minimap rendering, sound effect handling, and the main game loop (`animate`). It imports Three.js using the import map defined in the HTML.
